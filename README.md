Tracking progress:   

Part 1: Knowledge and Understanding                                                 
 
~~Gas law is clearly stated in words.~~  

~~Control variables and changing variables identified.~~  

~~Equation used for mathematical analysis is properly represented.~~  

~~Units for variables are correctly identified; necessary/possible unit conversions are addressed.~~  
  
~~Quiz question 1 is appropriate for selected gas law.~~
  
~~Quiz question 2 is appropriate for selected gas law.~~
  
Quiz question 3 shows higher level thinking and/or research and is appropriate for selected gas law. (TBD, the question can be solved entirely without the formula) 
  

Part 2: Thinking and Investigation
  
~~Sample problems (at least 2) are presented.~~
  
~~Sample problems are solved correctly, with clear and logical reasoning steps provided.~~
  
~~The solutions of 3 quiz questions are detailed, thorough, and correct.~~


Part 3: Communication

Students present the information in a clear and  confident manner.

Visuals (e.g., graphs, videos, online simulations, and/or live demonstrations) are used effectively to support the presentation.

Presentation completed in allocated time (10-15 minutes).

~~Appropriate use of terminology and concepts when discussing gas laws.  If multiple groups are presenting the same law, there should be no overlap or missing concepts.~~

~~Units are used throughout the solutions of sample problems and 3 quiz questions; final answers are presented with the correct number of significant digits and units.~~


Part 4: Application

Real-world applications of the gas law are provided (at least 3).

Students effectively link the gas law to the real-world applications (i.e, connection to assigned gas law is explicit and logical). 

Students demonstrate creativity in presenting the gas law:
material is presented in an engaging way with unique examples, ideas,  diagrams and/or analogies.
presentation includes an interactive segment that invites audience participation and/or discussion.
