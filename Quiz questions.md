## Question 1

A gas sample occupies a volume of 3.0 L and contains 0.12 mol of gas at constant temperature and pressure.  
What volume will the gas occupy if the amount is increased to 0.30 mol?

## Question 2

At constant temperature and pressure, 1.5 mol of nitrogen gas occupies a volume of 36 L.  
What volume will 0.50 mol of nitrogen gas occupy under the same conditions?

## Question 3

A balloon is inflated using a mechanical pump, every second 2 moles of air is pumped into the balloon, at 20 seconds the balloon has a volume of 500 mL.

Under constant pressure and temperature: 

1. How many moles of air is used when its volume reaches 100 mL?  
2. How long does it take to reach the volume?
