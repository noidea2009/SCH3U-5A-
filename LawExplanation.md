# Explaining the law with a thought experiment taken from the text book

imagine 2 identical tanks one with hydrogen and oxygen

pressure and temperature are constant 

the ideal gas law states : PV = nRT

Temperature measures the average kinetic energy of particles, not their mass.

And as we all know average kinetic energy of atoms affect pressure

Temperature is kept as a constant to exclude it as a variable that affects volume 

when number of moles increase pressure must also increase if volume and temperature is constant

Therefore when Pressure and Temperature is constant, represented as:

V = nRT/P 

where when you increase n, only V will increase to keep temperature and pressure constant
